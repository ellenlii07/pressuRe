\usage{
select_steps(
  pressure_data,
  threshold_R = 10,
  threshold_L = 10,
  min_frames = 10,
  steps_Rn = 5,
  steps_Ln = 5,
  skip = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pressure_data}{List. First item should be a 3D array covering each
timepoint of the measurement. z dimension represents time.}

\item{threshold_R}{Numeric. Threshold force to define start and end of step}

\item{threshold_L}{Numeric. Threshold force to define start and end of step}

\item{min_frames}{Numeric. Minimum number of frames that need to be in step}

\item{steps_Rn}{Numeric. Target number of steps for right foot. User will be
asked to keep selected steps until this target is reached or they run out of
candidate steps}

\item{steps_Ln}{Numeric. Target number of steps for left foot. User will be
asked to keep selected steps until this target is reached or they run out of
candidate steps}

\item{skip}{Numeric. Usually the first few steps of a trial are accelerating
and not representative of steady state walking so this removes them}
}
\value{
\itemize{
  \item pressure_array. 3D array covering each timepoint of the measurement.

  \item pressure_system. String defining pressure system
  \item sens_size. Numeric vector with the dimensions of the sensors
  \item time. Numeric value for time between measurements
  \item masks. List
  \item events. List
